        <h3>What problem are we solving?</h3>
        <p>Access to the data that cities generate, from budget line items to building permits to crime incidents, is both vital to the health of our democracy and highly valuable to commercial industries such as news media, construction, finance and real estate. In spite of its value, gaining access and extracting useful information remains difficult. NearbyFYI is building new methods and technologies to make extraction easier, lower costs to municipalities and data consumers, and provide free public access through a simple API.</p>

        <h3>How are we solving it?</h3>
        <p>NearbyFYI generates structured city data from public, but difficult-to-access information within closed systems and their unstructured documents. We clean, classify, and extract semantic metadata from these documents and provide a simple, public API to access the structured data.</p>

        <h3>How is it different?</h3>
        <p>In contrast to current solutions, our open data platform is free for cities and towns and their constituents. We build low cost, software as a service solutions for municipalities that replace their existing tools. This makes the collection of data easier and then charge a fee to commercial users of the API. We believe that this new model flips what was a previous expense line item into an overall cost savings for cities and towns.</p>

        <h3>What do we want to do?</p>
        <p>Our vision is to create the largest, highest quality and most diverse set of structured data about our cities and towns. By keeping our API public and affordable, weâ€™ll encourage the creation of a diverse group of tools by us and by others that provide easy access to important information for governments, citizens and businesses.</p>
