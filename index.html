        <h3>We're like Google for cities and towns</h3>
        <p>Sort of. If you've ever needed to extract useful, structured information 
           from the documents that local government provide you know that it is painful. 
           Writing screen scrapers, web crawlers, extracting data and text from PDFs, Word and
           Excel documents. Cleaning that data and then providing it in a structured form so
           that you can use it in your application. <strong><emphasis>NearbyFYI provides free public 
           access to meeting minutes, building permits and budgets through a <a href="http://said.nearbyfyi.com/docs/V1/">simple API</a></emphasis></strong>.</p>

        <h3>How are we solving it?</h3>
        <p>NearbyFYI generates structured city data from public, but difficult-to-access information within closed systems and their unstructured documents. We clean, classify, and extract semantic metadata from these documents and provide a simple, public API to access the structured data.</p>

        <h3>How is it different?</h3>
        <p>In contrast to current solutions, our open data platform is free for cities and towns and their constituents. We build low cost, software as a service solutions for municipalities that replace their existing tools. This makes the collection of data easier and then charge a fee to commercial users of the API. We believe that this new model flips what was a previous expense line item into an overall cost savings for cities and towns.</p>

        <h3>What do we want to do?</h3>
        <p>Our vision is to create the largest, highest quality and most diverse set of structured data about our cities and towns. By keeping our API public and affordable, weâ€™ll encourage the creation of a diverse group of tools by us and by others that provide easy access to important information for governments, citizens and businesses.</p>
