        <h3>We're like Google for cities and towns</h3>
        <p>Sort of. NearbyFYI is an API that provides access to structured data from 
           documents generated by our local city and town government.</p>
        <p>If you've ever needed access to structured information and data
           from your city or town government, then you know how painful it can be. 
           You'll need to create screen scrapers, setup web crawlers and processing
           pipelines to locate and extract data and text from the from the PDFs, Word 
           and Excel documents that government loves to generate.
        <p>Once you have liberated the data from the documents, you'll need to clean, 
          analyze, annotate and archive it.</p>

        <h3>How are we solving it?</h3>
        <p>NearbyFYI generates structured city data from public, but difficult-to-access 
        information within closed systems and their unstructured documents. We clean, 
        classify, and extract semantic metadata from these documents and provide a simple, public API to access the structured data.</p>

        <h3>How is it different?</h3>
        <p>In contrast to current solutions, our open data platform is free for cities and towns and their constituents. We build low cost, software as a service solutions for municipalities that replace their existing tools. This makes the collection of data easier and then charge a fee to commercial users of the API. We believe that this new model flips what was a previous expense line item into an overall cost savings for cities and towns.</p>

        <h3>What do we want to do?</h3>
        <p>Our vision is to create the largest, highest quality and most diverse set of structured data about our cities and towns. By keeping our API public and affordable, weâ€™ll encourage the creation of a diverse group of tools by us and by others that provide easy access to important information for governments, citizens and businesses.</p>
